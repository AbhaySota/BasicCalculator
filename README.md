# BasicCalculator
Basic Calculator App used to perform basic MATHEMATICAL operations ( ADD , MULTIPLY , DIVIDE etc. ). 
Built this to learn basics of UI design ( linear layout , weights , margins , padding etc. )
Will change it and will make a scientific calculator out of it once I learn a few more things.
